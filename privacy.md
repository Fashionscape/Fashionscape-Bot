# Privacy Policy
**Last updated and effective: July 29, 2020**

In compliance with Discord’s new Terms of Service regarding Bot/API usage, the FashionScape Bot has created a privacy policy to provide transparency to users regarding the information our bot collects, why it collects this information, and how data is used. A link to this privacy policy can be found by running the `~privacy` command in any Discord server that uses our bot.

# Stored Data
## Server Data
The FashionScape Bot tracks the “Guild Snowflakes” (also known as “Server ID”) of Discord Servers.

## User Data
The FashionScape Bot tracks the “User Snowflakes” (also known as “User ID”) of Discord accounts.

## User Content
The FashionScape Bot stores permanent links of user-provided images that have been posted to its designated gallery channels.


# Why data is stored, and how we use your data
Data and information are not collected beyond the base information necessary for the FashionScape Bot to perform its necessary functions for users. Such information is outlined below as follows:

## Guild Data:
- Guild IDs are stored so that the bot may use custom prefixes and settings as a guild's administrators see fit. It is also used to prevent the bot from joining a guild, should the guild prove to be abusing or misusing either the bot, or Discord/Jagex Terms of Service.

## User Data:
- User IDs are stored so we can track and give attribution to users who submit screenshots to the FashionScape Bot’s gallery.
- User IDs may also be stored to deny a user from utilizing some or all features of the bot, if we suspect the user to be abusing or misusing our services.

## User Content: 
- Images posted to gallery channels are not stored directly by the FashionScape Bot. Rather, the bot first uploads them to a private imgur gallery, and retrieves the link. This link is then stored in the bot's database as part of the gallery.
- Text-based content that is sent in the same message as the image being posted. In Discord, this will be the message posted in the “Add A Comment” box in an image upload. [Here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/458346171681996815/737738392929829007/meta-describe.png?width=400&height=293) is an example.
  - This meta information is only collected so users may add clarifying information to their outfit submissions, such as components used in its creation. In addition, it can be used to credit someone if the outfit was not self-made.

# Accessing and deleting your data
You may request deletion of your data by contacting Salmonllama#5727 or another FashionScapers Administrator. To do this, either join our discord and ping one of us, or create an issue on GitHub. A link to both are provided at the bottom of this privacy policy.

# Our Disclosure of Your Information.
We are not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties, as set forth below:
- Consent: We may transfer your information with your consent.
- Related Companies: We may also share your information with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. For example, because the FashionScape Bot stores submissions on a private Imgur gallery, that information is sent to Imgur, who are considered to be a “related company.”
- Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

# Unsolicited Suggestions
You may provide us with ideas for new FashionScape Bot functions, or modifications to existing features, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Suggestions”). All Unsolicited Suggestions shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.

# Children
Our Services are for users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us through one of our listed contact outlets at the end of this privacy policy. Note: In some countries, the age of digital consent is older than 13. If you are in those countries, you must be at least that age to use the Services. For example, for residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, FashionScape Bot will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.

# Security
We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.

# Your Data Rights & Choices
- **How can I access the personal data you have about me?**

If you would like to submit a data access request, please contact us through one of our listed contact outlets at the end of this privacy policy. We will then start the process and provide you a link to access the personal data that FashionScape Bot has on you within 30 days.

- **How do I correct, update, amend, or delete the personal data you have about me?**

Please contact us with an explanation of what data subject right you are seeking to exercise. For your protection, we may take steps to verify identity before responding to your request.

- **How do I object or restrict the manner in which Discord processes my personal data?**
You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in certain circumstances—for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate.

# Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
